# Parametric Box Creator for Fusion 360

This project contains a Python script for Autodesk Fusion 360 that automates the creation of a rectangular box. The script prompts the user to enter a desired width, depth, and height, and then generates a 3D model based on those parameters.

## Deliverables
- **Python Script:** `CreateBox.py`
- **Model Screenshots:** Before and After images showing the script in action.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Autodesk Fusion 360 installed.
2.  Download the `CreateBox.py` script from this repository.
3.  Open Fusion 360.
4.  Navigate to the **UTILITIES** tab in the top toolbar.
5.  Click **Scripts and Add-Ins**.
6.  In the "Scripts and Add-Ins" dialog, select the "My Scripts" folder and click the **`+`** icon.
7.  Create a new folder for the script (e.g., "BoxCreator") and copy the `CreateBox.py` file into that directory.

## Usage

1.  Open Fusion 360.
2.  Go to **UTILITIES -> Scripts and Add-Ins**.
3.  Find the `CreateBox` script under "My Scripts".
4.  Select it and click **Run**.
5.  You will be prompted to enter the width, depth, and height for the box.
6.  After entering the values, the script will automatically generate the 3D model in your active design.
